# Stayin' Alive

I recently started playing World of Warcraft Classic on a hardcore realm.
I thought to myself how amusing it would be if, upon leveling, a quick clip of
the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive" played. I decided to make it a reality.

StayinAlive has three events:

* Leveling up (plays a clip from the Bee-Gees' _Stayin' Alive_)
* Escaping from your demise (plays a clip from Pearl Jam's _Alive_)
* Your demise (plays a clip from Queen's _Another One Bites the Dust_)

# Installing

Head over to https://github.com/iachievedit/StayinAlive/releases

Find the latest release and download either the `.zip` (Windows) or
`.tar.gz` (macOS).  Extract into your AddOns folder.

For example, in _Classic Era_ on a Mac, extract the file in 
`/Applications/World of Warcraft/_classic_era_/Interface/AddOns`.  On a Windows PC, `C:\Program Files (x86)\World of Warcraft\_classic_era_\Interface\Addons`.  Rename the folder to `StayinAlive`.

# Options

Use `/stayinalive` to bring up options.  There are only two at the moment:

* Whether or not to post to your guild StayinAlive events
* What health level will trigger Pearl Jam's _Alive_ sound clip

# Fair Use

The songs _Stayin' Alive_ by the Bee Gees, _Alive_ by Pearl Jam,
and _Another One Bites the Dust_ are copyrighted material.

I do not own the rights to these songs nor have I been granted permission to use them by the copyright holders. However, I believe that using short audio clips from each in this context
