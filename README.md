# Stayin' Alive

I recently started playing World of Warcraft Classic on a hardcore realm.
I thought to myself how amusing it would be if, upon leveling, a quick clip of
the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive" played. I decided to make it a reality.

# Installing

Stuff goes here for install instructions!

# Options

Use `/stayinalive` to bring up options.  There are only two at the moment:

* Whether or not to post to your guild Stayin' Alive events
* What health level will trigger "I'm still alive"

# Fair Use

The song 'Stayin' Alive' by the Bee Gees is copyrighted material.  Likewise,
the song 'Alive' by Pearl Jam is copyrighted material.

I do not own the rights to either song nor have I been granted permission to use
them. However, I believe that using short audio clips from each in this context constitutes
Fair Use as provided for in section 107 of the US Copyright Law.
